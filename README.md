# LeRobot Dataset Visualizer

LeRobot Dataset Tool and Visualizer is a web application for interactive exploration and visualization of robotics datasets, particularly those in the LeRobot format. It enables users to browse, view, and analyze episodes from large-scale robotics datasets, combining synchronized video playback with rich, interactive data graphs.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to help robotics researchers and practitioners quickly inspect and understand large, complex datasets. It fetches dataset metadata and episode data (including video and sensor/telemetry data), and provides a unified interface for:

- Navigating between organizations, datasets, and episodes
- Watching episode videos
- Exploring synchronized time-series data with interactive charts
- Analyzing action quality and identifying problematic episodes
- Visualizing robot poses in 3D using URDF models
- Paginating through large datasets efficiently

## Key Features

- **Dataset & Episode Navigation:** Quickly jump between organizations, datasets, and episodes using a sidebar and navigation controls.
- **Synchronized Video & Data:** Video playback is synchronized with interactive data graphs for detailed inspection of sensor and control signals.
- **Overview Panel:** At-a-glance summary of dataset metadata, camera info, and episode details.
- **Statistics Panel:** Dataset-level statistics including episode count, total recording time, frames-per-second, and an episode-length histogram.
- **Action Insights Panel:** Data-driven analysis tools to guide training configuration — includes autocorrelation, state-action alignment, speed distribution, and cross-episode variance heatmap.
- **Filtering Panel:** Identify and flag problematic episodes (low movement, jerky motion, outlier length) for removal. Exports flagged episode IDs as a ready-to-run LeRobot CLI command.
- **3D URDF Viewer:** Visualize robot joint poses frame-by-frame in an interactive 3D scene, with end-effector trail rendering. Supports SO-100, SO-101, and OpenArm bimanual robots.
- **Annotations Panel:** Hand-edit the v3.1 language schema (`language_persistent` + `language_events`) — subtask, plan, memory, interjection + paired speech, and VQA atoms with bounding-box / keypoint / count / attribute / spatial answers. VQA bboxes and keypoints render as overlays on the video player; drag or click on a camera to draw new ones. Backed by an optional FastAPI service (in `backend/`) for parquet rewrites and HF Hub push.
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Uses parquet and JSON loading for large dataset support, with pagination, chunking, and lazy-loaded panels for fast initial load.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, modern user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **Recharts** (for data visualization)
- **Three.js** + **@react-three/fiber** + **@react-three/drei** (for 3D URDF visualization)
- **urdf-loader** (for parsing URDF robot models)
- **hyparquet** (for reading Parquet files)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its package manager. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` or other files in the `src/` directory. The app supports hot-reloading for rapid development.

### Loading datasets

The home-page input accepts three source formats:

- A Hugging Face dataset id, such as `lerobot/pusht`
- A dataset stored below the repository root, such as
  `simple-world-lab/HiFi-UMI-2K/chunk-0000/part-0000` (a copied Hugging Face
  `/tree/main/...` URL also works)
- An absolute local LeRobot directory, such as `/data/lerobot/my_dataset`
  (`~/...`, `file://...`, and Windows drive paths are also recognized)

The selected directory must itself contain the standard LeRobot folders,
including `meta/`, `data/`, and `videos/`. Local files are read by the Next.js
server, so the server process needs read permission for the directory. Local
videos are streamed through a same-origin endpoint with HTTP Range support.

When running in Docker, mount the dataset into the container and enter the
container path in the UI, for example:

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -v /host/datasets:/datasets:ro \
  lerobot-visualizer
# Enter /datasets/my_dataset in the visualizer.
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun start

# Run linter
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format
```

### Desktop application

The Electron application embeds the standalone Next.js server, so it supports
the same Hugging Face and local dataset sources without requiring a separate
server process.

```bash
# Run Next.js and Electron in development
bun run desktop:dev

# Build installers for the current operating system
bun run desktop:dist
```

GitHub Actions builds `.AppImage` and `.deb` packages on Linux, `.exe` on
Windows, and `.dmg` on macOS. Pushing a tag such as `v0.1.0` publishes all four
artifacts to a GitHub Release. Builds are unsigned unless signing credentials
are configured in the repository, except macOS builds, which always sign the
complete application bundle (ad-hoc when no Developer ID certificate is supplied).

#### macOS signing and verification

The macOS job mounts the generated DMG, copies its application, verifies all code
signatures, and smoke-tests the embedded server. Run the same check locally after
`bun run desktop:dist`:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke-test-macos-dmg.sh dist-electron/*.dmg
```

Ad-hoc signing repairs the bundle's integrity but does **not** establish a trusted
developer identity or provide Apple notarization. Downloaded ad-hoc builds may
still be blocked by Gatekeeper. For a build you trust, try opening it once, then
use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**, as described in
[Apple's instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445). Do not disable
Gatekeeper system-wide. If an older build reports that it is damaged, replace it
with a newly built package; the v0.1.0 macOS release skipped bundle signing.

For Developer ID signing and notarization, configure these GitHub Actions secrets:

| Secret                        | Value                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `MAC_CSC_LINK`                | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`        | Password used when exporting the `.p12`        |
| `APPLE_ID`                    | Apple developer account email                  |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for that account         |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`               | Apple Developer team ID                        |

Non-PR macOS builds use these credentials to sign and notarize the app. When a
certificate is configured, missing notarization credentials fail the build; the
DMG check also requires a stapled notarization ticket and Gatekeeper acceptance.
PR builds always use ad-hoc signing without these secrets. For local Developer ID
builds, electron-builder accepts `CSC_LINK` / `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` (or `CSC_NAME`
for a certificate in your keychain) plus the same `APPLE_*` environment variables.
See [electron-builder's signing documentation](https://www.electron.build/v26/docs/features/code-signing/code-signing-mac/).

### Environment Variables

- `DATASET_URL`: (optional) Base URL for dataset hosting (defaults to HuggingFace Datasets).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOTATE_BACKEND_URL`: (optional) URL of the FastAPI annotation
  backend (`backend/app.py`). When set, the Annotations tab can save edits and
  rewrite parquet shards / push to the Hub. When unset the tab is read/edit
  only with sessionStorage persistence.

## Annotations backend (optional)

The Annotations tab edits LeRobot v3.1 language atoms — `language_persistent`
(broadcast subtask/plan/memory) and `language_events` (per-frame
interjection / vqa / speech) — and renders existing bbox/keypoint atoms over
the video player. Edits live in `sessionStorage` by default; to write the
new columns into `data/chunk-*/file-*.parquet` (matching the writer in
[lerobot#3471](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/3471)) and push the
result to the Hub, run the bundled FastAPI service:

```bash
# 1. install + start the backend (port 7861 by default)
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --port 7861 --reload

# 2. start the visualizer with the backend URL configured
cd ..
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANNOTATE_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7861 bun run dev
```

The backend exposes:

- `POST /api/dataset/load` — load a dataset by `repo_id` or `local_path`
- `GET  /api/episodes/{ep}/atoms` — list atoms for an episode
- `POST /api/episodes/{ep}/atoms` — replace atoms (event timestamps are
  snapped to exact source-frame timestamps before persisting)
- `GET  /api/episodes/{ep}/frame_timestamps` — used client-side for snapping
- `POST /api/export` — rewrite parquet with the new language columns plus
  the dataset-level `tools` column (drops legacy `subtask_index`)
- `POST /api/push_to_hub` — export and push to a target repo

## Docker Deployment
